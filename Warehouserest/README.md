# Warehouse REST

Warehouse is a RESTful application which has products and an inventory.
The product consists of parts and the inventory has articles.

The aim for this program is to show how you can load JSON files at startup, through the CommandLineRunner interface.
How to perform various CRUD activities on the database, which uses MongoDB with a combination of MongoTemplate and MongoRepository.

There is currently no frontend and you can check the endpoint either through the browser at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products and http://localhost:8080/api/v1/inventory or through Postman.


The application is currently in development
